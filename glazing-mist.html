    <p class="glaze-mist-description">The MIST (Manipal Institute of Science and Technology) Glazing platform serves as a central hub for student innovation and collaboration within the university. It is designed to be a transparent and accessible space where ideas can be polished and brought to life, much like glazing a finished product to give it a brilliant sheen. The platform is home to MKST, a collective of creators, developers, and designers dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what is possible. Through a blend of creative and technical expertise, MKST facilitates a community where students can showcase their projects, receive constructive feedback, and find the resources needed to turn their concepts into tangible realities.

Beyond a simple showcase, MKST and the Glazing platform foster a culture of open-source knowledge and continuous learning. It is a dynamic ecosystem where senior students mentor juniors, and inter-departmental teams form to tackle complex challenges. The collaborative environment encourages a free exchange of ideas, ensuring that every project, from a simple web application to a complex robotic system, benefits from the collective intelligence of the entire student body. This focus on shared growth and technical excellence is what defines the MKST experience and the core mission of the Glazing MIST initiative.</p>
